# Chipin, Mobile application for debt management in group trips

## Description
Chipin is a mobile app for debt management in joint trips. In the application, it will be possible to create a group to which friends 
will join before the trip. Then users can add transactions of who paid for whom in a restaurant, for museum tickets, for hotel 
accommodation, and so on. The application calculates all debts (including currency conversion if the trip is to a country with a 
different currency), and clearly shows who has to pay the debt to whom after returning home.
