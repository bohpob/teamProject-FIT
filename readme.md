## Chipin, Mobile application for debt management in group trips
In the application, it will be possible to create a group to which friends will join before the trip. Then users can add transactions of who paid for whom in a restaurant, for museum tickets, for hotel accommodation, and so on. The application calculates all debts (including currency conversion if the trip is to a country with a different currency), and clearly shows who has to pay the debt to whom after returning home. Users can choose who pays next in two ways: based on who has the biggest debt or randomly.
